# Frontend Mentor - Social media dashboard with theme switcher solution

This is a solution to the [Social media dashboard with theme switcher challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-media-dashboard-with-theme-switcher-6oY8ozp_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

Did not want the data to be stored statically on the HTML page.  So I placed the data on a Firebase realtime database and fetched the data.
